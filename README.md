# flutter_storage

A commit-log-based database for flutter apps written in Dart.

## Key Features

- Backend runs in a separate thread using an Isolate
- Keys are indexed in memory, values are cached in memory
- Commit-log with undo-support
- Simple serialization and deserialization of models
- Compaction-support
- One file per database

## Motivation

Flutter and Dart are awesome. Why not having a database for document-oriented apps written in and for both.
